# [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName) Python Script V1.2 üîç
As a regular contributor to Project [WhatsMyName](https://whatsmyname.app), this is a python script I made for myself to check if sites are working, and I thoroughly enjoyed making it.. 

The script is unofficial and is not part of project WhatsMyname.

The code has been put through `Security Bandit` to test for any issues, and also through `Code Black` to get a nice style that fits with PEP8 requirements.

Feel free to use it, it's open source, that's what it is for!

# Support ‚ô°
There is no support button on this repository, this is because WhatsMyName is not my project, `this is my own personal script`,  all support should go to the Project [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName) and to [@WebBreacher](https://ko-fi.com/WebBreacher). **DO NOT DONATE TO ME**

# Usage üìñ
I wanted something pretty simple to use, these are the only commands you should know:<br>

<br>

- **Help command**: 
```
python3 whatsmyname.py -h 
```
<br>

- Check **number of sites** currently supported on Project WhatsMyName:
```
python3 whatsmyname.py -c 
```
<br>

- Check the Project WhatsMyName **Full sites List**:
```
python3 whatsmyname.py -f
```
<br>

- Scan Project WhatsMyName (full sites list) for a single **Target Username**:

```
python3 whatsmyname.py -u anonymouse
```
<br>

- **Single Site Search** for a Target Username, for example you want to know if secretmonkey is on Ebay:

```
python3 whatsmyname.py -u secretmonkey -s ebay
```

# .HTML Report Generation 
This provides an easy and smooth way to have a general view of all the sites found, to click links one after the other, and to keep/save the data.

# Latest Improvements üöÄ

- Links were made clickable (May 2024), Special thanks to [boringthegod](https://github.com/boringthegod) for the request and idea.
- The scan is now much faster (May 2024), and is still accurate. (But it's always worth comparing with WhatsMyName Web to be on the safe side).
- **HTML Report Generation** (May 2024): The user now gets a .html report at the end of the scan, all links are in one place, and can be clicked, or kept somewhere as proof.
