# [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName) Python Script 🔍
As a regular contributor to Project [WhatsMyName](https://whatsmyname.app), this is a python script I made for myself to check if sites are working, and I thoroughly enjoyed making it.. 

The script is unofficial and is not part of project WhatsMyname.

The code has been put through `Security Bandit` to test for any issues, and also through `Code Black` to get a nice style that fits with PEP8 requirements.

Feel free to use it, it's open source, that's what it is for!

# Support ♡
There is no support button on this repository, this is because WhatsMyName is not my project, `this is my own personal script`,  all support should go to the Project [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName) and to [@WebBreacher](https://ko-fi.com/WebBreacher). **DO NOT DONATE TO ME**

# Usage 📖
I wanted something pretty simple to use, these are the only commands you should know:<br>

<br>

- **Help command**: 
```
python3 whatsmyname.py -h 
```
<br>

- Check **number of sites** currently supported on Project WhatsMyName:
```
python3 whatsmyname.py -c 
```
<br>

- Check the Project WhatsMyName **Full sites List**:
```
python3 whatsmyname.py -f
```
<br>

- Scan Project WhatsMyName (full sites list) for a single **Target Username**:

```
python3 whatsmyname.py -u anonymouse
```
<br>

- **Single Site Search** for a Target Username, for example you want to know if secretmonkey is on Ebay:

```
python3 whatsmyname.py -u secretmonkey -s ebay
```
